                The goal of a Sudoku puzzle game is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3x3 section
                contain all digits between 1 and 9.  At the beginning of the game, the 9Ã—9 grid will have some of the squares
                filled in. Your job is to use logic to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid.
